# Type hinting in Python

Simon Kirby, March 2023

## Introduction

This is a quick project to go along with a small type hinting presentation. Examples have been written from scratch.

## Tooling

- Type hinting for this project has been managed with the VSCode Python extensions `Pylance` and `Pyright`. Please install these.
- A `settings.json` VSCode file has been created: please use this when running the project.
- Other static type checkers have not been tested or set up, i.e. `mypy`.
- `Poetry` has been used for virtual environment and dependency management. Install dependencies using `poetry install` when in the project root.
