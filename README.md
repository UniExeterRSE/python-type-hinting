# Type hinting in Python

Simon Kirby, March 2023

## Introduction

This is a quick project to go along with a small type hinting presentation. Examples have been written from scratch.

## Tooling

- `Poetry` has been used for virtual environment and dependency management. Ensure `Poetry` has been installed, and then install project dependencies using `poetry install` when in the project root.
- Type hinting for this project has been managed with the VSCode Python extensions `Pylance` and `Pyright`. These extensions have been listed in `extensions.json` file.
- A `settings.json` VSCode file has been also been created.
- Other static type checkers exist. These have not been use here, but please explore them. An obvious choice is `mypy`.
